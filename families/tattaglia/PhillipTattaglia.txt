Tattaglia heads one of New York's Five Families, which bears his name. Although his primary business is prostitution, he is the first to invest in Virgil Sollozzo's heroin trade, and wages war with the Corleone family after Vito Corleone refuses to provide financing and lend political and police protection to the enterprise.
The Tattaglia family attempt to assassinate Vito Corleone, first killing notorious Corleone enforcer Luca Brasi. Further attacks flounder, and Tattaglia is dealt a debilitating blow when the bloody conflict claims his son, Bruno, and after Vito Corleone recovers and resumes control of his family. After Vito's son, Sonny Corleone, is murdered, the two Dons negotiate an end to the protracted struggle. However, Tattaglia tellingly insists on Don Corleone's guarantee to honor the peace. After conceding to Tattaglia's demands, Corleone realizes that he fronted Emilio Barzini's master plan to collapse the Corleone empire, divide the spoils among the four remaining families, and embrace the heroin trade unopposed.
After the meeting, Vito tells Tom Hagen that Tattaglia is a "pimp" and never could have outfought Sonny. He realized at the meeting that Barzini was the mastermind behind the war and Sonny's assassination.
