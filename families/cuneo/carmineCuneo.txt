Known as one of the few Dons whose criminal activities had never been suspected by the police, Don Cuneo ran a fleet of milk trucks from The Bronx as a front for his illegal activities. This earned him the nickname 'The Milkman'. He was the second most senior Don on the Commission, after Vincent Forlenza of Cleveland. Always fond of children, during the peace meeting arranged by Don Corleone, Carmine made it a point that the future drug business would not involve children in any way.
