Don Anthony "Black Tony" Stracci is a fictional character who first appeared in Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather.
One of the dons of New York's Five Families, Stracci embraced the scheme of Don Emilio Barzini to unite against the Corleone family and force them into the heroin trade. He is present at the sit-down where the "Commission" of La Cosa Nostra families convince Don Vito Corleone to accept drug trafficking in his territory and guarantee peace.
In the The Godfather film, Stracci is named "Victor". On the day Michael Corleone "settles all family business", Stracci is assassinated by Corleone family caporegime Peter Clemenza; as Stracci and his associates take an elevator ride in a hotel, Clemenza guns them down. The actor who portrayed him was not credited.
