n the novel, it is said that he got his nickname because he has a nose like a Turkish scimitar. He also has a Turkish wife and children, and does much of his business (growing poppy) in Turkey. In the book, Sollozzo speaks Sicilian to Michael Corleone because he feels he can better express himself in that language. In the film, his English seems to be native and accent-free, though he still communicates with Michael in Sicilian. This may be to prevent corrupt Captain McCluskey, who is also in attendance, from understanding what they are saying.
